## üìå About this project

This project implements a RESTful API for managing a people catalog, using CQRS and Mediator patterns. It allows performing CRUD operations on a set of people, including create, read, update, and delete.

- __Back End__: Node.js, Express, Sequelize
- __Database__: MySQL

### üìå How to get started?

This project requires a `.env` file in the root directory for configuring your database and server.

File structure for `.env`:
- `DB_HOST='localhost'`
- `DB_USER='username'`
- `DB_PASSWORD='password'`
- `DB_NAME='database_name'`
- `PORT=3000`

#### ‚ùì Where do I find this data?
- You need to create a MySQL database on your system with a username and password. These are the `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD`.
- `PORT` will be the port your server runs on.
- `DB_HOST` is the host where your MySQL database is running.
- `DB_NAME` is the name of your database.

üìç To set up and run the project:

1. In the root directory:
   - Create a `.env` file as explained above.

2. In the Server folder:
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm start`

3. In the Client folder (optional if you want to set up a front-end):
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm start`
